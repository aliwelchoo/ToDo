# To Do Stack

This to do stack is for keeping track of tasks during the day.
The best use case is when you're working on Task 1, then you get distracted or take a break,
come back and start work on Task 2, only to realise hours later you didn't finish Task 1

There are buttons for ordering the tasks, the most important thing is that your top 1, 2 and 3 are in the right order

The calendar and rollover feature lets you use it each day and grab remaining tasks from the previous day and continue with them today
